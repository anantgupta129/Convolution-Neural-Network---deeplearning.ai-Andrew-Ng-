# Convolution-Neural-Network deeplearning.ai-Andrew-Ng-

This repository contains all the solutions of the programming assignments. It also has some of the important papers which are referred during the course. :)

**NOTE** : Use the solutions only for reference purpose 

**Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks**
- **Learning Objectives** :
   1. Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks, inception nets etc.
   2. Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
   3. Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
